    <h2>This is Pesto Pasta</h2>
    <p>The name pesto is the past participle of the Genoese verb pestâ (Italian: pestare), which means "to pound", "to
        crush", in reference to the original method of preparation. According to tradition, the ingredients are
        "crushed" or ground in a marble mortar through a circular motion of a wooden pestle.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        1 (16 ounce) package pasta
        2 tablespoons olive oil
        ½ cup chopped onion
        2 ½ tablespoons pesto
        salt to taste
        ground black pepper to taste
        2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook
        pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and
        transfer into a large bowl.
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3
        minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until warmed through.
        Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat.
    </ol>
